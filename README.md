# README

This repository contains detailed writeups of various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges I have participated in. For those who may be unfamiliar, Capture the Flag events are a type of competition in the realm of cybersecurity where participants are presented with a series of puzzles, tasks, and vulnerabilities that they must identify and exploit to find the hidden flag. Throughout each write up I will attempt to showcase the intricate details of both the vulnerability and solution of the challenge. By sharing these writeups, I am hoping to document my learning journey, showcase my problem-solving skills, and contribute to the CTF community. Whether you're a fewllow CTF enthusiast, a beginner looking to embark on their cybersecurity journey, or even a recruiter, I hope you find these writeups informative and engaging.

Feel free to explore through the different challenges and their corresponding writeups. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesistate to reach out. Let's keep learning and improving toether!

Happy Hacking.
